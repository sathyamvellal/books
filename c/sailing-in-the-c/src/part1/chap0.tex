\section{Program \#1: Hello World}
And finally, after all that theory, we're now down to business. \textbf{Hello World} is a tradition I must embrace! So I'm now going to present to you a minimalistic program in C which simply displays ``Hello World". What I'll do, is show you the program and then explain what it does. So here it goes - \\

\begin{ccode}
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf ("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
\end{ccode}
\\

Okay, so that's like 7 lines of code but it says a lot about a C Program!
