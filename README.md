Books
=====

This repo contains the books that I'm writing. My inspiration for authoring these books comes from gathering the required knowledge in those topics/domains in one place (which is scattered into pieces over the net) and also from various people in my life.

### Currently Writing

1. Sailing in the C
    Expect beta in September 2014

### Planned Books : 

1. C++ (Title Unknown)

### LICENSE

This repo and the books are not under any license as of now. This is mainly because I'm still writing them and I don't want anyone to end up with an incomplete version of these books.
